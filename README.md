Yark lets you continuously archive all videos and metadata of a channel. You can also view your archive as a seemless offline website ðŸ¦¾

## Installation

To install yark, simply download it off of PyPI:

```shell
$ pip3 install yark
```

## Managing your Archive


Once you've installed yark, think of a name for your archive and copy the target's channel id:

```shell
$ yark new owez UCSMdm6bUYIBN0KfS2CVuEPA
```

Now that you've created the archive, you can tell yark to download all videos and metadata:

```shell
$ yark refresh owez
```

Here's what my channel looked like after following the steps (if anything was updated/deleted it would be blue/red to indicate):

<p><img src="examples/images/reportadd.png" alt="Report Demo" title="Report Demo" width="500" /></p>

<!-- TODO: new demo, this one doesn't include video downloading. maybe include blue/red -->

## Viewing your Archive

Viewing you archive is very simple, just type `view` and optionally the archive name:

```shell
$ yark view owez
```

This will pop up an offline website in your browser letting you watch all videos ðŸš€

<p><img src="examples/images/channels.png" alt="Channel Demo" title="Channel Demo" width="600" /></p>
<!-- TODO: <p><img src="examples/video.png" alt="Channel Demo" title="Channel Demo" width="600" /></p> -->
<!-- NOTE: do this with a video without a desc so you can see the statistics a tiny bit -->

## Details

Here are some things to keep in mind when using yark; the good and the bad:

- Don't create a new archive again if you just want to update it, yark accumulates all new metadata for you via timestamps
- Feel free to suggest new features via the issues tab on this repository
- Scheduling isn't a feature yet, please use [`cron`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) or something similar
- Scheduling once a day is recommended because getting metadata takes ages!
